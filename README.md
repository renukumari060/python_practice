## Python Functions Practice

1. Write a function that finds a maximum out of 3 different numbers and display the following message: "The greatest number is: " + maxNumber.
2. Write a function that adds minimum 2 numbers but can add more if needed, display the following message: "The total is: " + total. (use Variable-length Arguments)
3. write a program that ask for the name of a patient and also asks the age, then it will calculate the age of a person and display a message "the Patient " + Name + " is of age." or " is underage."
4. Write a function that will add all numbers greater or equal to 10 from a list of numbers
5. Write a function that will show the inverse version of a given string. Example: given string "hola" reverse string "aloh".
6. write a function that will divide 2 numbers, use an anonymous function for this. And display a message with the result. num1/num2.
7. write a program that will count the number of letters "a" in a string, after show the following message "The number of iterations of letter A is: " + counterA.
8. write a function that will fin the minimum of 3 numbers and display the following message "The smallest number is: " + maxNumber.
9. Write a function that given a list of numbers, it will return new list of numbers only displaying one time each element. Example: list (1,1,1,2,2,3,3,5,6) new list (1,2,3,5,6)
10. Write a function that given a list of numbers, it will generate two new lists of numbers, one with the odd numbers and one with the even numbers.
